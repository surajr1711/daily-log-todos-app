Watched Doom game 2020 videos, Cosmos videos by Neil De Grasse Tyson etc. Then started daily log up to now. Then did yesterday's review up to 1030.",

Ask yourself 1 question, 20 years into the future, for what things; regardless of the outcome, would you like to say I'm glad I did rather than I wish I had. Do things regardless of the outcome.

Get up and make your bed, after breakfast do the dishes, set a time for emails, etc. If you don’t stick to a routine and handle these things when they're supposed to be done, then when you walk by your room and see and your bed is not made, that will start to grow in your head. The same for dishes and everything else. If you see it not done, it will grow and weigh you down.",
